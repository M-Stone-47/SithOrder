    <h2>Darth Vader</h2>
    <p>Real Name: Anakin Skywalker</p>
    <p>Age at death: 45</p>
    <p>Master: Darth Sidious</p>
    <p>Darth Vader once was a Jedi Knight called Anakin Skywalker who was trained by Obi wan Kenobi. He was born as a Slave on Tatooine until the Jedi Master Qui Gon Jinn and his Padawan Kenobi Found him. They sensed that he was very gifted in the force and freed young skywalker so they can take him to corucant that he could be trained as a Jedi, at first the high council of the Jedi said no because he was too old to be trained as a jedi, they argued about the fact that Anakin could be the chosen one who would bring balance to the force but the Jedi wouldn't listen. Only after Qui Gon was killed and asked Obi Wan to promise that Anakin will be trained they accepted the training.</p>
    <p>Right after the begin of the clone wars he married Padme Amidala, a Senator of Naboo, despite the Jedi code forbidding him to love. he also grew close the the Chancellor called Palpatine, which became almost like a father to him. over the course of the clone wars he became a Jedi Knight and a general of the republic army, his clone battalion was called the 501th. At the end of the clone wars he and Obi Wan went back to crorucant to rescue the Chancellor from the Separatist and he killed Count Dooku in the Process. After that he was assinged to be on council by the Chancellor, the Jedi accepted that but didnt promote him to the rank of master, which infuriated Anakin. at the same day they asked him to spy on the chancellor, that infuriated Anakin even more and made him question the Jedi.</p>
    <p>After he Killed Count Dooku his wife told him that he was going to be a father. Since then he always has visions of his wife dying in child birth and he feared losing her. when then the Chancellor revealed to him that he was a Sith lord and has the power to save her, he immediately ran to the Jedi and reported what he found out, but when they told him to stay put, he realized that the jedi didnt respect him and that he has to choose between his wife and the order. He choose his wife and ran of to the chancellors office where Mace Windu and Sidious are fighting. Mace is able to disarm Sidious and is now ready to end it, but Anakin wants that he is given a fair trial, and when he sees that the Jedi still wants to kill him he Jumps in and slashes the jedis hand of with his lightsaber and Sidious did the rest. After this he Surrenders to Sidious and becomes his new apprentice with the name Darth Vader.</p>
    <p>His first order was to go to the Jedi Temple and kill everyone inside, he did just that, he killed everyone even the children were slaughtered by him and his clones. then he went to mustafar and killed the leader of the Seperatists, there he waited for more orders until his wife came, but she brought his former master, who survied order 66, with her. That made him so angry that he choked her with the force until she fell on the floor, Obi Wan saw that and couldnt believe his eyes and engaged Lord Vader in an Epic Duel, Obi Wan won and Lord Vader lost all of his legs, an arm and was falling down to the lava river below where Obi Wan left him burning.</p>
    <p>After the duel on mustafar he was found and Rebuild by Sidious and remained his apprentice until he saved his son Luke from the Emperor and killed him. After that he was redeemed and has been forgiven by his old master and friend Obi Wan who showed him how he can transfer his essence to the force to become a force ghost.</p>
