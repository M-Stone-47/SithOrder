    <h2>Darth Maul</h2>
    <p>Real Name: Unknown</p>
    <p>Home planet: Dathomir</p>
    <p>Age at death: 52</p>
    <p>Master: <a href="SidiousC.html">Darth Sidious</a></p>
    <p>Darth Maul is a Zabrak from the planet Dathomir son of the Witch Talzin, where he was recruited by Sidious as a child and trained to be a Sith assassin. After years of training he became blood thirsty and really wanted to kill jedi but knew he has to wait until the plan was ready to reveal the Sith. When the day came he dueled a Jedi master and a Jedi padawan on the planet Naboo, killing the Jedi master Qui Gon Jinn but was cut in half by the padawan Obi Wan Kenobi.</p>
    <p>He survived the duel, but was left without legs so he build himself some, slowly loosing his mind but his hatred for Kenobi kept him alive until his brother Savage Opress found him an brought him back to Talzin on dathomir, there he got know robotic legs and got his sanity back, now he and his brother search for Kenobi for revenge but never succeeding in killing the now Jedi Master. After the last duel with kenobi he and his brother flee to outer space where they get unconscious from their injuries. lucky for them they where rescued by the Death Watch and Maul again got new, more human like bionic legs. There he formed an alliance with the Death Watch to take over mandelore and started a plan to take over the City without much Fighting. He Recruited every Crime Family in the Galaxy and killed those who wouldn't join him. with the help of them they took over the city after which he and his brother were betrayed by the Death Watch and imprisoned </p>
    <p>After they woke up in their cells, they instantly broke out and got back to the palace where he challenged the leader to a duel till death. He won and took over mandelor where he was visited by his old master Darth Sidious, who believed that Maul was becoming a rival and attacked them killing Savage and Capturing Maul. After a while he escaped again and went back to mandelor where he went hidden till the Jedi Ahsoka tano found and Captured him again to bring him to coruscant.</p>
    <p>Thanks to Order 66 he escaped without ever arriving at Coruscant, hiding himself from Sidious and Vader ruling his Crime Syndicate from the shadows</p>
    <p>After a while he, with the help of a young Jedi, found out that Kenobi still lives and hides on Tatooine, instantly going there to search for him. When he found him, he tried to kill Kenobi but got killed by him instead.</p>
