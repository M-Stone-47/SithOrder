    <h2>Darth Bane</h2>
    <p>Real Name: Dessel</p>
    <p>Home planet: Apatros</p>
    <p>Age at death: 46</p>
    <p>Master: 6 Diffrent Sith</p>
    <p>Darth Bane was a legendary human male Dark Lord of the Sith and the sole survivor of the destruction of the Brotherhood of Darkness at the hands of the Jedi Order during the Jedi-Sith War a thousand years before the Clone Wars. As the only surviving Sith, Bane recognized that Sith infighting had weakened them to the point that the Jedi could destroy them. To rectify this, Bane reformed the Sith and created the Rule of Two, mandating that there could be only two Sith, a Master and a apprentice, at any given time. These new Sith would begin a plot to destroy the Jedi and conquer the galaxy in secret. With Bane's defeat, rumored to have been caused by his apprentice, Darth Zannah, on the Inner Rim world of Ambria, the Jedi wrongly believed that the Sith were defeated with him.</p>
    <p>The vendetta Bane held against the Jedi was fulfilled during the Clone Wars, when Supreme Chancellor Sheev Palpatine, secretly the Sith Lord Darth Sidious and a follower of the Rule of Two, transformed the Galactic Republic into the Galactic Empire and destroyed the Jedi Order. However, the victory was short-lived, as the redeemed Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker, formerly the Sith Lord Darth Vader, defeated the Sith twenty-three years later.</p>
