    <h2>Darth Vitiate</h2>
    <p>Real Name: Tenebrae</p>
    <p>Home planet: Medriaas</p>
    <p>Age at death: 1487</p>
    <p>Master: Had no Master</p>
    <p>Tenebrae, also known as Vitiate, the Sith Emperor and Valkorion, was the Dark Lord of the Sith and the ruler of the Sith Empire. He declared himself as the new Sith Emperor and ruled over the Sith after the Great Hyperspace War. Since his arrival on Dromund Kaas, the Emperor isolated himself from his people and started on his lifelong quest to destroy the entire galaxy and obtain eternal life.</p>
    <p>After Marka Ragnos died, and the Sith Empire lost the Great Hyperspace War against the Galactic Republic, Lord Vitiate called all living Sith Lords to his world to perform a ritual to wipe out the Republic. However, the ritual was a scam to grant eternal life and he single-handedly wiped out every living thing on the planet, including the Force. After the ritual he lead the surviving Sith into space, fleeing from the Republic and hoping to find a proper planet. After several years floating in space they found Dromund Kaas. Lord Vitiate declared himself as Sith Emperor and promised his people vengeance.</p>
    <p>About three hundred years later the Emperor found his armada ready for war against the Republic, and so the Great Galactic War began. After 28 years the Sith Empire managed to win the war, but the Republic wasn't defeated. A peace treaty was settled between the two factions and the Emperor became the ruler of half the Galaxy. During the Cold War, the Emperor was attacked at his Emperor's Fortress|fortress but managed to defeat the strike team and brainwashed them as his pawns. One Jedi Knight managed to break free from the Emperor's will and allied with Scourge to take down the Emperor. Eventually, they followed the Emperor to the Dark Temple and defeated the Emperor, destroying his body. Later, however, an Emperor's Hand member confirmed the Emperor was still alive.</p>
