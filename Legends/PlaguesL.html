    <h2>Darth Plagueis</h2>
    <p>Real Name: Hego Damask</p>
    <p>Home planet: Mun</p>
    <p>Age at death: 115</p>
    <p>Master: Darth Tenebrous</p>
    <p>Darth Plagueis was a Sith lord who studied the force to that point that he could cheat death itself, he could even manipulate the force to create life, its said that he created Anakin Skywalker that way. He was the Master of Darth Sidious and planned together with him the fall of the republic and the destruction of the Jedi Order.</p>
    <p>Hego Damask was a Mun from the planet mun where he was CEO of the Bank Damask Holdings of the Banking Clan. He inherited it from his father. But when he wasn't managing his bank he was experimenting with the force and some corpses he collected, sometimes he even experimented on the living. He was gifted with the Force and was a Master with the lightsaber, only few could best him in a fight, so to only thing he feared was death. He experimented with the Force until he was able to keep a dying body alive.</p>
    <p>Shorty after he discovered how to cheat death, he was killed by Sidious in his sleep. its unknown if he still lives or if hes really dead, but as far as the Galaxy is Concerned hes dead.</p>
