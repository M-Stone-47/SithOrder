    <h2>Darth Malgus</h2>
    <p>Real Name: Veradun</p>
    <p>Home planet: Dromund Kaas</p>
    <p>Age at death: Unknown</p>
    <p>Master: Darth Vindican</p>
    <p>Malgus and his Master Vindican had led the victorious recapture of the Sith world Korriban, before he struck down his master for being injured at the hands of Jedi Master Kao Cen Darach. At the height of the war, Malgus led a surprise assault on the Core World of Alderaan; though initially successful, Malgus and his forces were defeated in a concentrated Republic counterattack led by his nemesis from Korriban, future Grand Master Satele Shan. The Sith Lord was heavily wounded during the battle, and was forced to wear a respirator for the remainder of his life. Once the Empire entered into sham peace negotiations with the Republic, which were truthfully nothing more than a distraction from the Sith's true target: the Republic capital of Coruscant. Malgus was chosen by his superior Darth Angral to participate in the attack on Coruscant as the leader of a strike team that would invade the Jedi Temple. Malgus succeeded in killing a substantial number of Jedi defenders ,including Jedi Master Ven Zallow, who has been recognized as his most notable kill, before the Sith fleet arrived to lay waste to the rest of the world. By the end of the engagement, the Sith had destroyed the Jedi Temple, killed half of the members of the Jedi High Council, and disgraced the Jedi Order in the eyes of the Republic.</p>
    <p>After the Emperor died he tried to he tried to creat a new Empire with him as Emperor and those who wouldnt join him would die, so he declared war on the new empire. after that he got engaged and killed on his ship by a group of sith and bounty hunters </p>
