    <h2>The rule of two</h2>
    <p>The Sith never really cared for rules, except this one rule called the rule of two that was created to end the endless killing on sabotaging each other, so from the day Darth Bane Killed every Sith and Created the Rule of two there shall only be a master that holds the power and a apprentice that craves for the knowledge of his master and as soon as the apprentice surpasses the master and Successfully kills him he himself becomes the master and takes on an apprentice, that was continued for a thousand years of making alliances and sabotaging the Republic. </p>
    <p>Of Course, all of that only worked because Bane let it look like the Sith went extinct, so the jedi slowly forgot about them and started to become arrogant and lazy, So when the Sith revealed themself with Darth Maul, they first didnt believe that the Sith have returned until Qui Gon was killed on Naboo by Darth Maul. But the grand plan of the sith was almost completed and can hardy be stopped by the Jedi.</p>
