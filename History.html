    <h2>History of the Sith</h2>
    <p>The Sith Where a Ancient Order that used the dark side of the force, they where the Ancient Enemy of the Jedi order and wanted nothing more than destroy them. Thats Because the Sith Believed that the Jedi are week fools which dont use their gift of the force to rule but rather to protect those that can't protect themselfs.</p>
    <p>They wanted to rule the galaxy, most Empires of the Sith were Ruled by an emperor, he was the most powerful and gifted in the arts of the Sith. Every Sith was eager to get more power for themself so they started killing each other, thats why they lost most of the wars against the Jedi, they eradicated themselves almost to extinction.</p>
